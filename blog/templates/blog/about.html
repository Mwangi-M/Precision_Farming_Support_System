                            <strong>More Cost Efficient farming</strong><br>
                            Precision farming aims to reduce a farmer’s expenditure by minimising the need for things like fertiliser, pesticide and herbicide. Over a growing season, grower’s are
                            seeing significant reductions in the amount of money they are spending on all of the above where technology is using the components sparingly and only where needed.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <div align="justify">
                            <strong>Higher Yields and more Profitability</strong><br>
                                Statistically, a precision farmer will make more money than a traditional farmer. This is for a number of reasons. Their yields are higher because they have improved
                                growing practices and they are able to sell more produce at the end of the season as a result. They also have less man hours to expend as technology is filling gaps that
                                workers would have previously filled.
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <div align="justify">
                            <strong>Less Waste</strong><br>
                                Lost crops are a nightmare for farmers, and over a growing season there is expectation that a certain number of crops will not see the season through.
                                Making this worse is that historically storage practices inevitably resulted in further spoilage. With streamlined growing processes and healthier crops,
                                they have a much better chance of surviving and growing seasons are becoming more sustainable.
